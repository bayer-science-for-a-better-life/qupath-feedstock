#
# QuPath conda-forge friendly recipe
#
# Since the JDK situation in conda-forge is at the moment a bit stuck,
# we repackage QuPath releases, including the current JRE used to develop them.
#
# This package allows using QuPath both as a standalone application or pimped
# from python using "paquo", that should be able to automagically find qupath
# when this package is installed.

    # TODO: work some proper tests in windows (when we setup access to a VM or get a windows machine)

    # So we only check that the files exist in the package...
    - if exist %LIBRARY_PREFIX%\QuPath\QuPath.exe (exit 0) else (exit 1)  # [win]

    # maybe do run some script to exercise the library (e.g. make sure openslide is found and works correctly)
    # maybe install ququ and test some bindings

about:
  home: https://qupath.github.io/
  license: GPLv3
  # TODO probably we should specify license_file with all licenses from qupath deps... they are included anyway in package
  # Maybe copy them as part of the build process (see e.g. the ffmpeg windows recipe)
  summary: QuPath is an open, powerful, flexible, extensible software platform for whole slide image analysis.
